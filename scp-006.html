                <p>Whereas the nature of SCP-006 does not warrant any extensive containment, a certain level of secrecy
                    is necessary regarding the object's existence and properties, for obvious reasons. The following
                    procedures are required not for personnel safety, but to deny or hide knowledge of SCP-006's effects
                    from the personnel who interact with it.</p>

                        <!-- Procedure for personnel interaction and suit requirements -->
                        <li>All personnel interacting with SCP-006 in any physical way are required to wear modified
                            Class VI BNC suits. Before personnel are allowed to perform procedures, they must be briefed
                            with Material SCP-006B or SCP-006C. SCP-006A Briefing is the correct one and is restricted
                            to only those with O5 clearance. To ensure personnel are wearing suits properly, they are to
                            be submerged into a pool of water. Any air bubbles spotted signify a leak in the suit.</li>
                        <!-- Procedure for surveillance and emergency evacuation -->
                        <li>Procedures with SCP-006 are to be carried out under extreme surveillance. In case of
                            contact with SCP-006, the commander in charge will announce Procedure 006-Xi-12, which the
                            personnel have been briefed to believe to mean high toxicity is present and they must
                            evacuate.</li>
                        <!-- Approval and containment requirements for liquid from SCP-006 -->
                        <li>Any procedure in which liquid is acquired from SCP-006 must be approved by three (3) O5
                            level personnel. The liquid is to be transferred in a Quad-Sealant Container and under armed
                            guard.</li>
                        <!-- Termination procedures for personnel exposed to SCP-006 -->
                        <li>If at any time personnel come into contact with SCP-006 or liquid from SCP-006, they are
                            to be confined and terminated after sufficient studies are done. Due to the nature of
                            SCP-006, the most effective termination method is incineration. (For full report, see file

                <!-- Description of SCP-006 -->
                <h3>Description:</h3>
                <p>SCP-006 is a very small spring located 60 km west of Astrakhan. Foundation Command was aware of its
                    existence since the 19th century, but were unable to secure it until 1991 due to political reasons.
                    On the spot of the spring, a chemical factory has been constructed as a disguise, with the majority
                    of laborers under Foundation and/or Russian control. The liquid emitted from the spring has been
                    chemically identified as simple mineral water in 1902, but has the unusual property of "health".</p>
                <p>Ingesting the liquid produces the following properties in human beings: the ability to regenerate DNA
                    damaged by sufficient duplication, heightened excitement of cellular duplication, vastly improved
                    abilities in the repair of damaged tissue, and a frightening increase in the effectiveness of the
                    human immune system. Upon testing the liquid on animal subjects, hostile bacteria and viral agents
                    were destroyed immediately. Many reptiles and birds were unaffected, while higher primates
                    experienced the same benefits as humans.</p>
